I walked over to the other side, give him the otp. Right upto that point the destination address was displayed properly. After typing in the OTP the drop point displayed was my pick up point.\nThere's the glitch, the driver requested I check. I did. My details show correctly as I booked them. It didn't show the same on his device, and he tells me I've entered the wrong details, that he'll drop me to my pick up point from where I walked to catch my ride in the first place.\nHe tells me it's my mistake and that I'm not the only one who knows to use technology.\nHe spoke much too much than was necessary.\nHe called his supervisor and spoke of my rash talk, NOBODY wants to hear a whole doze of yelling first thing the morning!\n\nWhen the supervisor requested to speak with me, when I explained the situation, she had the decency to apologise for the problem.\nBut it wasn't over!\nThis man! After a whole lot of drama he drove the auto while talking on the phone constantly complaining about me to his (pretend) supervisor. And when I did ask him to stop talking, he refused. Asked him to give me the phone so I can speak as well, he refused.\nHe went out of line and said \" I should listen to him complain during the ride \". He continued talking on the phone while driving which is violation101.\nYou guys are no competition to Uber. I am certainly NOT the first of customers complaining about ola drivers or their terrible services!",

But when the 1st passenger drop was completed, the driver told me that mine would be the 3rd drop as his App interface showed the same even though my drop location was just 2km away from the Passenger-1 drop location & the Passenger-3 location was 6kms away. The driver gave me a helpless look as there is nothing that he could do. I de-boarded the cab as 6km to & fro in Bangalore would have delayed me by atleast 30-45mins. After de-boarding I contacted the customer care for 2 reasons - 1. To end my ongoing trip as the driver was unable to do that 2. Request a partial refund as I wasn't dropped at my desired destination.\nI was first attended by Wilfred. The arrogant way he spoke made me feel that I have taken some favor from him for free. Realizing that I was not going to get any solution from Wilfred, I asked my call to be escalated. I was next connected to Deepa. Surprisingly, from the start of the conversation, she wasn't even ready to listen to my issue and kept on repeating \"We understand your inconvenience, but there is nothing we can do\". Moreover, the condescending way she spoke made me realize that OLA is far from being a customer centric company & with un-trained and un-empathic customer service reps like Wilfred & Deepa, the company would only go downwards.",
